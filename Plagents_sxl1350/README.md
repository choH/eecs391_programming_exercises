### Description

#### FirstAgent.java

A resource collection agent can create new units of farm, barracks and footman with sufficient resources. 

#### MyCombatAgent.java

A automatically combatting enemies agent with better strategy instead of killing enemies directly in order. 



### Experience

Through the programming process, I have a general concept of the action operation of agents. The repeating data modifying makes me understanding how the agent works automatically and their behavior patterns. 



### Questions

In the combat agent project, I tried to shorten the time of moving during the process of units getting close to enemies gradually. I found that the units turned around enermies several times which is a time waste and reduce  chances of attacking. So I'm confused about how to reduce the time of moving to have more time to attack.
