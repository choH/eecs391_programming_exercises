## To TA/Grader

Since we have decided to migrate the collaboration to `GitHub` for better readability and potential useful features like [*issues*](https://github.com/choH/eecs391_programming_exercises/issues), this repository
will be mirror to and bare-clone from `csevcs` at least once a week.

Also, we realized many projects of this class requires quite intensive amount of debugging, so sometime we'd work on the same computer and therefore submitted in a fashion of `co-author`.

## To Partner

Usually I will polish our repository before mirroring, but in case that I am not available and you need to mirror our work to `csevcs`, please do:

```
your_work_dir $ git clone --bare https://github.com/choH/eecs391_programming_exercises
your_work_dir $ cd eecs391_programming_exercises
eecs391_programming_exercises $ git push --mirror https://csevcs.case.edu/git/2020_spring_391_27
```

Note this maneuver will completely overwrite the repository on `csevcs` â€” which shouldn't be a big deal since all our development are initiated here, but please be caution.

## Acknowledgement

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, CWRU has shifted to remote learning â€” which I remotely learned â€” and the professor has decided to disband groups to issue individual assignments. Thus, commits before [`80d6e8c`](https://github.com/choH/eecs391_programming_exercises/commit/80d6e8c2fedebf797c3000dfc66fb322f74edb86), which marks the delivery for [./P4agents](https://github.com/choH/eecs391_programming_exercises/tree/master/P4agents), are the collaborative work done by *Group 27*. Where commits after [`80d6e8c`](https://github.com/choH/eecs391_programming_exercises/commit/80d6e8c2fedebf797c3000dfc66fb322f74edb86) are the solo work of Henry.

Acknowledgement to *Group 27* members Cathy Li ([@lsq2412230983](https://github.com/lsq2412230983)), Henry ZHONG ([@choH](https://github.com/choH)) ~~, and of course to the countless CWRU upperclassmen who left there legacy on GitHub ðŸŽ‰~~.
